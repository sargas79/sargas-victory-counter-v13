/**
 * Victory Counter — module entry point.
 *
 * A shared multi-track progress counter for any game system. The GM creates any
 * number of named tracks and adjusts progress; every player sees the same live
 * state in a collapsible on-screen overlay.
 *
 * The module stores its entire state in world-scoped settings and never reads
 * or writes Actors, Items, Scenes, Journals or any other world document. That
 * is what makes it system-agnostic: there is no system data to be compatible
 * with, so no system needs to be declared, detected or special-cased.
 *
 * @module victory-counter
